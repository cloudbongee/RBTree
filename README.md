# RBTrees in C++ (17 or more)

## Free to use
I like sharing... because that is caring. Please feel free to give red black trees as much love as you can, so my tuition is worth the many cents.

## Why?
Red black trees are a self-balancing data structure that permits running your run-of-the-mill binary tree operations in a whooping $O(\log{(n)})$ time. This is a beautiful optimzation for your average joe tree.
One good use of the red black tree is mathematics: great examples of optimized use-cases in infimum and supremum finding in a set of numbers, or subset intersections if applied with field extensions. The world is your oyster!

## What do you offer thus far? 
Simply two files. Your header and your c++ file. All you require is to fire up the thinking caps, and brace for insertion, deletion, finding, removing.
